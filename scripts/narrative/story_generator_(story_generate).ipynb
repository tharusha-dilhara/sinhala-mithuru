talk primarily because they are **social creatures with a remarkable capacity for vocal learning and mimicry**. It\\'s not about understanding human language in the way we do, but rather about replicating sounds they hear in their environment for various social and survival reasons.\\n\\nHere\\'s a breakdown of the key reasons:\\n\\n**1. Social Bonding and Communication:**\\n\\n*   **Mimicry of Flock Calls:** In the wild, parrots live in flocks and communicate with each other through a variety of calls. Mimicking these sounds is crucial for staying connected, warning of danger, and coordinating activities. They essentially learn the \"language\" of their flock.\\n*   **Strengthening Social Bonds:** When a parrot imitates sounds from its human \"flock\" (you!), it\\'s a way of forming a bond and showing affiliation. They are essentially saying, \"I\\'m part of your group, and I recognize your sounds.\"\\n*   **Getting Attention:** Parrots are intelligent and understand that making noise can elicit a response from their caregivers. Talking or making specific sounds is a way to get your attention, whether it\\'s for food, interaction, or just because they want you to acknowledge them.\\n\\n**2. Vocal Learning and Intelligence:**\\n\\n*   **Brain Structure:** Parrots have a unique brain structure that allows for complex vocal learning. They have a specialized \"song system\" similar to songbirds, which is highly developed for producing a wide range of sounds.\\n*   **Imitation as a Survival Skill:** In the wild, being able to mimic sounds can help them blend in with their surroundings to avoid predators or to attract mates.\\n*   **Cognitive Abilities:** Parrots are highly intelligent birds. Their ability to learn and remember sounds, and even associate them with specific contexts or rewards, demonstrates their cognitive prowess.\\n\\n**3. Associative Learning and Context:**\\n\\n*   **Connecting Sounds to Outcomes:** While they don\\'t *understand* words like we do, parrots can learn to associate specific sounds or words with certain events, people, or objects. For example, they might learn that \"hello\" means you\\'re entering the room, or \"treat\" means they\\'ll get something tasty.\\n*   **\"Speaking\" in Context:** This is where it gets fascinating. Some parrots can learn to use words or phrases in a contextually appropriate way, leading to the illusion of true understanding. For instance, a parrot might say \"bye-bye\" when someone is leaving or \"good boy/girl\" after a positive interaction. This is learned through repeated association and reinforcement.\\n\\n**4. Play and Entertainment:**\\n\\n*   **Curiosity and Exploration:** Parrots are naturally curious and enjoy exploring their environment. Mimicking sounds is a form of play and exploration for them.\\n*   **Enjoyment of Making Noise:** Some parrots simply seem to enjoy the act of making noise and vocalizing. It can be a form of self-expression or a way to entertain themselves.\\n\\n**In summary, parrots talk because:**\\n\\n*   **They are social animals programmed to communicate.**\\n*   **They possess exceptional vocal learning abilities.**\\n*   **They learn to associate sounds with specific meanings and outcomes through observation and reinforcement.**\\n*   **It\\'s a way to bond, get attention, and express themselves.**\\n\\nIt\\'s important to remember that while their vocalizations can be remarkably human-like, they are not comprehending the nuances of human language in the same way we do. Their \"talking\" is a sophisticated form of mimicry and learned association.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.5-flash-lite', 'safety_ratings': [], 'model_provider': 'google_genai'}, id='lc_run--019b7aa7-4b18-7960-8c0b-12dee642a419-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 6, 'output_tokens': 735, 'total_tokens': 741, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}})"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Example using a local image file encoded in base64\n","image_file_path = \"/content/drive/MyDrive/story_generation_comprehension/story_generator/images/Sunny-Farm-Story.jpg\"\n","\n","with open(image_file_path, \"rb\") as image_file:\n","    encoded_image = base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode(\"utf-8\")\n","\n","message_local = HumanMessage(\n","    content=[\n","        {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"Generate the simple story about this image in sinhala language,2. generate the 3 mcq questions and answer in simhala \"},\n","        {\"type\": \"image_url\", \"image_url\": f\"data:image/png;base64,{encoded_image}\"},\n","    ]\n",")\n","result_local = llm.invoke([message_local])\n","print(f\"Response for local image: {result_local.content}\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Hngkj3HiuWNB","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1767290300717,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4633,"user":{"displayName":"Ishini Tecla","userId":"11322021249840097510"}},"outputId":"1dce9187-04a2-4b21-f519-d851df0473a6"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Response for local image: ## කතාව:\n","\n","ගොවිපොළක ලස්සන දවසක්. අශ්වයා, බැටළුවා, ඌරා සහ ඌරු පැටියා එළියේ සෙල්ලම් කරමින් සිටියා. ගොවිපොළේ රතු පාට ට්‍රැක්ටරයක්, විශාල තණකොළ ගොඩක් සහ රතු පාට කොටුවක් තිබුණා. කොටුවේ උඩ තට්ටුවේ කුකුළෙක් කූඩුවක වාඩි වී සිටියා. ඌරා මඩේ නෑමට කැමති වුණා. ගොවිපොළේ අයට මේ දවස ගොඩක් සතුටින් ගෙවුණා.\n","\n","## ප්‍රශ්න:\n","\n","1.  **මෙම රූපයේ සිටින සතුන් කවුරුන්ද?**\n","    *   (අ) සිංහයා, කොටියා, අලියා\n","    *   (ආ) අශ්වයා, බැටළුවා, ඌරා, ඌරු පැටියා, කුකුළා\n","    *   (ඇ) බල්ලා, පූසා, හාවා\n","\n","2.  **ගොවිපොළේ ඇති රතු පාට වාහනය කුමක්ද?**\n","    *   (අ) ට්‍රැක්ටරයක්\n","    *   (ආ) මෝටර් රථයක්\n","    *   (ඇ) බයිසිකලයක්\n","\n","3.  **කොටුවේ උඩ තට්ටුවේ සිටින්නේ කවුද?**\n","    *   (අ) බැටළුවෙක්\n","    *   (ආ) ඌරෙක්\n","    *   (ඇ) කුකුළෙක්\n","\n","## පිළිතුරු:\n","\n","1.
